Large parts of the room is covered by a thick layer of dust and settled down smoke, but parts of the wooden floor are uncovered by footprints. They must be recent. You find sets of normal shoeprints and smaller, paw like. An electric hum lies in the air.


        At the side of the room there is a counter. Behind the counter - a bartender. Lifeless.

As you approach the bar, you hear the sound of spinning gears. A stream of musty warm air escapes the vent.


        You hear the sound of an old timey needle printer and a slip of paper appears from a small slit on the top of the couner.
